Here's a structured representation of the OCR data in a tabular format. The structure attempts to group words based on their layout appearing to fit into columns and rows, though without specific context from the original document, certain assumptions are made. 

### Table Structure

This is a simplified version and would require adjustments based on the actual layout, column widths or merged cells in the context of the document to accurately reflect the original format.

### Notes
- Rows and columns were generated based on distinct vertical and horizontal positioning in the OCR data.
- Specific columns may contain different lengths or types of content, leading to the irregular design of this table.
- Further details such as headers can be added based on contextual information or section titles present in the document, which are not provided in the OCR output. 
- If you have any specifics about the structure or context where these words belong, please provide them for a more accurate portrayal.
